# Scientific Calculator
This project is a scientific calculator implemented in C++ using the Qt framework to provide a graphical user interface (GUI). It offers various mathematical functionalities, including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and calculation history recording.

Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Trigonometric Functions: Calculate sine, cosine, tangent, etc.
Logarithmic Functions: Compute logarithms of numbers.
Calculation History: Record and display the history of calculations performed by the user.
Operations Utilized:
Class: Object-oriented programming concepts are used to structure the codebase.
Inheritance: Inheritance is employed to create derived classes with specialized functionality.
Maths Functions: Standard mathematical functions provided by the C++ <cmath> library are utilized for calculations.
Vector: The std::vector container is used to store calculation history.
Try and Catch: Exception handling with try and catch blocks is implemented to handle errors gracefully.
Stack: A stack data structure may be used internally for expression evaluation or calculation history storage.
File Handling: File handling operations are employed for saving and loading calculation history to/from disk.
Getting Started
To use the calculator, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE (e.g., Qt Creator).
Build and run the project.
Use the GUI interface to perform calculations.
Dependencies
This project relies on the following dependencies:

Qt framework
Ensure that you have Qt installed on your system before building and running the project.

Usage
Upon launching the application, you'll be presented with a user-friendly interface containing buttons for digits, arithmetic operators, trigonometric functions, logarithm, memory operations (e.g., clear, recall), and calculation history.

Simply click on the buttons to input your desired calculations and view the results on the display area.
